# Parks Lookup API

#### By: Estevan Lopez

## Description
This project is called the "Park Lookup API" and serves as an archive of national parks. It fulfills an epciodus prompt for creating an API with ASP.NET Core. It utilizes Swashbuckle an implimenatation of swagger which can documents endpoints. 

## Technologies Used
- C#
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Core
- MySQL
- Postman
- Github
- Swagger
- Vs Code 

## Setup/Installation Pre-reqs

1. Install the `dotnet-ef` tool by running the following command in your terminal: 
``dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0``
2. Enter the command ``dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`` in Terminal.
3. [Download and install the appropriate version of MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
4. [Download and install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).


### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ParksLookupApi".
3. Within the production directory "ParksLookupApi", create two new files: `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code. Make sure to replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values in the MySQL database connection string with your own username and password for MySQL. 

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=parks_lookup_api;uid=[YOUR_USERNAME];pwd=[YOUR_PASSWORD];"
  }
}
```

5. Within `appsettings.Development.json`, add the following code:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Trace",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

6. Create the database using the migrations in the ParkLookupApi project. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) to the production directory "ParksLookupApi", and run `dotnet ef database update`. You may need to run this command for each of the branches in this repo. 
7. Within the production directory "ParksLookupApi", run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project server and monitor it. 
9. Use your program of choice to make API calls. In your API calls, use the local host domain _http://localhost:5000_. 
10.  Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_/swagger to view endpoints through swagger ui. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. 

## Endpoints and Further Exploration
Explore the API endpoints and test them in Postman or Swagger ui in a browser accessed through localhost (see step above) otherwise look below.
There is full CRUD functionality for the 'Parks' class, here are the endpoints.

## Note on CORS
CORS is a W3C standard that allows a server to relax the same-origin policy. It is not a security feature, CORS relaxes security. It allows a server to explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others. An API is not safer by allowing CORS. For more information or to see how CORS functions, see the Microsoft documentation. The attempt at implementing cors is on the second branch to leave the first in good condition.
